- 🌱 I’m currently learning pentesting As a dedicated professional in Application Security Services, I specialize in Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Mobile Application Security Assessments (MAST), and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) utilizing a variety of industry-leading tools. My work is guided by established standards from OWASP and SANS, ensuring a robust understanding of security practices. I am passionate about empowering developers to write secure code by providing education on vulnerabilities and potential remediation strategies and researching about new methodologies to enhance application security practices. Additionally, I actively contribute to develop a culture of security awareness through frequent learning sessions focused on secure coding practices.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new tools related to pentest or updating existing tools. Or develping frameworks for testing different kinds of systems
